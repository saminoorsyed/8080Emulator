# Emulator8080

Description: This Repository is focused on building an Emulator for the 8080 processor with a group of 4 fellow students over the course of 3 months. Our eventual goal is to run the Space invaders game on it. As a side effect of the above goal, I hope to further my knowledge of the C++ and C programming languages as well as Assembly Language and the low level programming that is involved with operating computer systems.

## Project outline and order of goals:

The following will be the basic order in which our team tackles building our project:

-Set up environment and ensure team members can successfully compile code with requisite basic libraries
-Build a disassembler for the Space Invaders ROM.
    -Based on 8080 opcode
    -Document disassembled code for human readability
-Build an Emulator File for the 8080 Processor.
    -Write emulator shell
    -Implement code for basic logic groups
    -Implement instructions required for 8080 assembly code
    -Debug, debug, debug
-Build an emulator file for the hardware of the arcade processor.
    -Visual interrupts
    -Processor timing
    -Audio outputs
    -Keyboard inputs
    -Debug
-Build a file for interpreting i/o from our computers
    -Keyboard inputs
    -Audio outputs
    -Platform-specific instructions/code
    -Debug
-Build a GUI to interact with the Emulator
    -Start game option
    -Exit game option
-(Optional) Add additional games for emulation
    -Implement additional assembly instructions
    -Add game-selection for GUI
    -Debug and ensure that hardware i/o is consistent
-Play the Game

## Set up environment and ensure team members can successfully compile code with requisite basic libraries

- We will be using C++ for the majority of our code.
- We will also use some assembly language for our project. 
- Over the course of our project, we will conduct research and test several libraries for building GUIs. We have done some preliminary research into libraries like GTK and Qt, but have not yet made a decision on which library to use.


## Build a disassembler for the Space Invaders ROM.


### tokens.cpp
This file will define the appropriate output given an input using the op codes provided in the 8080

## Build an Emulator File for the 8080 Processor.


## Build an emulator file for the hardware of the arcade processor.


## Build a file for interpreting i/o from our computers


## Build a GUI to interact with the Emulator
